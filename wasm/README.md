# Canvas3T WASM Tools

This crate contains performance-sensitive helpers for the Canvas3T editor. Build the WebAssembly bundle with:

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../frontend/src/wasm/pkg
```

During local development you can run `npm run build:wasm` from `frontend/` to trigger the same command.
